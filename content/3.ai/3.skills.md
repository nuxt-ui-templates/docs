## What are Skills?

Skills are structured knowledge files that give AI coding agents context about a library, framework, or codebase. Unlike [MCP servers](/ai/mcp) that provide real-time tool access, skills are loaded directly into the agent's context so it can reference them throughout the conversation.

The [`skills`](https://skills.sh) CLI is the primary way to install and manage skills for your AI agents.

## Available Skills

Nuxt UI provides two skills:

- **Usage skill** - Teaches AI agents how to build UIs with Nuxt UI: installation, theming, components, composables, forms, overlays, and layouts.
- **Contributing skill** - Guides AI agents through Nuxt UI's component structure, theming patterns, testing conventions, and documentation guidelines when contributing to the repository.

### Usage Skill

The usage skill gives AI agents comprehensive knowledge about building with Nuxt UI v4. It covers:

- Official starter templates
- Layout composition (Dashboard, Docs, Chat, Editor)
- Form validation with Standard Schema
- Composables (`useToast`, `useOverlay`, `defineShortcuts`)
- All 125+ components with props and usage patterns
- Theming and branding with semantic colors and CSS variables
- Installation for Nuxt, Vue, Laravel, and AdonisJS

The skill includes additional references that the AI agent loads on demand based on the task, keeping responses focused and context-efficient.

### Contributing Skill

The contributing skill helps AI agents assist with contributions to the Nuxt UI repository. It automatically guides through:

- MDC documentation guidelines
- Vitest testing conventions
- Tailwind Variants theming patterns
- Component file structure and naming conventions

This skill is located in the repository at [`/.claude/skills/contributing/`](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/tree/v4/.claude/skills/contributing) and is automatically picked up when working in the Nuxt UI codebase with Claude Code or Cursor (when using a Claude model).

## Installation

### Using the Skills CLI

The easiest way to install the Nuxt UI skill is with the [`skills`](https://skills.sh) CLI. No prior installation is required:

```bash [Terminal]
npx skills add nuxt/ui
```

You can target a specific agent with the `--agent` flag:

```bash [Terminal]
npx skills add nuxt/ui --agent cursor
npx skills add nuxt/ui --agent claude-code
```

Or install globally so the skill is available across all your projects:

```bash [Terminal]
npx skills add nuxt/ui --global
```

Once installed, you can invoke the skill by typing `/nuxt-ui` in your agent's chat.

### Cursor

1. Open Cursor and go to **Settings** > **Skills**
2. Click **Add skill** and enter the following URL:

```text
https://github.com/nuxt/ui/tree/v4/skills/nuxt-ui
```

### Claude Code

Add the skill using the CLI command:

```bash [Terminal]
claude skill add https://github.com/nuxt/ui/tree/v4/skills/nuxt-ui
```

### Manual Setup

The skill files are publicly available on GitHub. You can reference them directly in any AI tool that supports custom context or instructions:

- Full skill directory: [`skills/nuxt-ui/`](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/tree/v4/skills/nuxt-ui)
- Skill entry point: [`skills/nuxt-ui/SKILL.md`](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/blob/v4/skills/nuxt-ui/SKILL.md)

## Supported Agents

The `skills` CLI supports 35+ agents including:

- [Cursor](https://cursor.com)
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview)
- [Codex](https://openai.com/index/codex/)
- [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf)
- [Cline](https://cline.bot)
- And many more
